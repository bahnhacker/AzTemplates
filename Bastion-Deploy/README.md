This template will deploy Azure Bastion in a new or existing Azure Virtual Network, along with dependent resources such as the AzureBastionSubnet, Public Ip Address for Azure Bastion, and Network Security Group rules.

ALL resources will be deployed within the SAME Resource Group and Azure Region. A new Virtual Network is only created if 'new' is selected.
